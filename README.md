## What is Zafiro?

Zafiro is an open-source intelligent Agent running on Android devices, with [BYOK](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/byok) support. It understands your screen, controls your device, and carries out operations across apps — with full support for Skills, MCP, and memory. It can also run Shell and Python 3 natively and wrap tools on its own to perform tasks such as web search and file downloads, or connect to a remote dev machine via SSH.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For native apps, Zafiro controls the phone via Accessibility Service; for non-native apps, it can also operate via [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) without Root. Root users get the full experience.

> You can download a release from [Releases](https://github.com/niki914/zafiro/releases/latest), or choose to [build from source](#from-source).

## Core Capabilities

### Modern UI Design Language

- **[Material 3 Expressive](https://m3.material.io/) & Apple Liquid Glass** - a modern, polished interface
- **Personalized Theming** - multiple theme colors with dark mode and dynamic color extraction
- **Multilingual Support** - English, 中文, 日本語, Español, Русский, العربية
- **Background Interaction** - sleek floating ball and notification tray UI to follow and interact with the Agent in real time

### Device Control

- **Screen Interaction** - open apps, pick music, order food — all done for you
- **Fully Visible** - an on-screen pointer shows every step the Agent takes

### Agent System

- **Out-of-the-Box** - built-in support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Kimi, Alibaba Bailian, SiliconFlow, and more
- **Extend as Needed** - full support for Skills and MCP, plus memory and a workspace — extend it your way
- **Permission Management** - with configurable rules, every command and piece of code is under your control
- **Context Management** - inspect context window usage at any time and compress it
- **Conversation Management** - branch, rewind, and regenerate any turn; all conversation data stays strictly local, and models can be switched on the fly within the same session

### Python Tools

- **Run Code Directly** - run Python 3 natively on the device
- **Meta-Tooling** - wrap your own Python tools; the Agent reuses and maintains the tools it creates
- **Built-in Scenarios** - web search, web page reading, and APK installation work out of the box

### Remote Environments

- **[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)** - use Linux commands and tools on your Android device
- **SSH** - connect to a dev machine or server to execute remote tasks
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** - issue dev tasks from your phone, executed by a remote Coding Agent

## Voice Assistant Takeover

Through the [LSPosed](https://github.com/lsposed/lsposed) framework, Zafiro can take over your system voice assistant — wake Breeno or XiaoAi, and the one actually answering is your own Agent. You can decide, based on keywords, which requests go to Zafiro and which pass through to the native assistant. After takeover, the assistant retains full Agent capabilities including device control.

> [!NOTE]
> Taking over the system voice assistant requires **Root + LSPosed**, and currently supports: OPPO - Breeno
>
> Voice takeover availability may be affected by phone model, system version, voice assistant version, and vendor system restrictions. When your device does not yet support system assistant takeover, you can still use Zafiro's chat interface with all Agent capabilities.

- An Android 11 or above device

<details>
<summary>Release Signing</summary>

To build a Release version yourself, use your own signing key:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore my-release.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my_key
