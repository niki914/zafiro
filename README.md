## What is Zafiro?

Zafiro is an intelligent agent running on your Android phone. We provide the Zafiro Agent with a full set of scaffolding so it can understand your screen, control your device, and carry out operations across apps. It can wrap tools on its own with Python to perform tasks such as web search, file downloads, and more. Zafiro supports memory, MCP, and Skills, and can also connect to a remote dev machine via SSH.

## Core Capabilities

### Modern UI Design Language

- **[MD3E](https://m3.material.io/) & Apple Liquid Glass** - a modern, polished interface
- **Dynamic Theming** - multiple accent colors with dark / light mode switching
- **Multilingual Support** - Chinese, English, Japanese, Spanish, and more

### Device Control

- **Screen Interaction** - open apps, fill forms, and switch pages in one go
- **Fully Visible** - an on-screen pointer animation shows every step the Agent takes

### Agent System

- **Out of the Box** - built-in Skills, MCP, memory, and takeover rules, no configuration needed
- **Extend as Needed** - supports custom tools, extend it your way
- **Permission Management** - every command that runs is under control

### Python Tools

- **Run Code Directly** - run Python natively on the device
- **Meta-Tooling** - wrap your own Python tools
- **Built-in Scenarios** - web search, web page reading, and APK installation work out of the box

### Remote Environments

- **[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)** - use Linux commands and tools on your Android device
- **SSH** - connect to a dev machine or server to execute remote tasks
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** - issue dev tasks from your phone, executed by a remote Coding Agent

## Voice Assistant Takeover

Through the [LSPosed](https://github.com/lsposed/lsposed) framework, Zafiro can take over your system voice assistant — wake Breeno or XiaoAi, and the one actually answering is your own Agent. You can decide, based on keywords, which requests go to Zafiro and which pass through to the native assistant. After takeover, the assistant retains full Agent capabilities including device control.

> [!NOTE]
> Taking over the system voice assistant requires **Root + LSPosed**, and currently supports:
>
> - OPPO / OnePlus / Realme | Breeno Assistant
> - ~~Xiaomi | XiaoAi~~ (no longer maintained — community contributors welcome)
>
> Voice takeover availability may be affected by phone model, system version, voice assistant version, and vendor system restrictions. When your device does not yet support system assistant takeover, you can still use Zafiro's chat interface with all Agent capabilities.
